## Core Features

This platform includes all the required features for a mini LinkedIn-like community:

-   **Secure User Authentication**: Complete JWT-based authentication system with registration and login.
-   **Dynamic User Profiles**: Users can view profiles that display personal information (name, bio) and a feed of their own posts.
-   **Public Post Feed**: A central feed where all user posts are displayed chronologically, showing the author's name and a timestamp.
-   **Post Creation**: Authenticated users can create and publish new text-only posts to the public feed.

## Extra Features & Enhancements

To demonstrate advanced skills and a focus on user experience, several extra features were implemented:

-   **Modern & Responsive UI**: The interface was built from the ground up with Tailwind CSS for a clean, professional, and fully responsive experience on all devices.
-   **In-Place Profile Editing**: Users can edit their own profile information (name and bio) seamlessly through a pop-up modal without leaving the page.
-   **Responsive Navigation**: Includes a polished hamburger menu for a smooth user experience on mobile and tablet devices.
-   **Optimistic UI Feedback**: Features skeleton loaders during data fetching and toast notifications for user actions (login, post creation, profile updates) to provide clear and immediate feedback.
-   **Secure API Design**: Backend API routes are protected using middleware, and security best practices are followed, such as server-side validation and preventing users from editing others' profiles.
-   **Professional Layouts**: UI elements like profile banners, overlaid avatars, and consistent card designs create a cohesive and visually appealing application.
